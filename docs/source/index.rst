pypowerup
=====================
``pypowerup`` is the Python implementation for the research article "PowerUp!: A Tool for Calculating Minimum Detectable 
Effect Sizes and Minimum Required Sample Sizes for Experimental and Quasi-experimental Design Studies (Dong & Maynard, 2013)". It is a 
power analysis tool for 21 experimental and quasi-experimental designs. 


Given study design, ``pypowerup`` computes minimum detectable effect sizes ``effect_size``, power ``power``, 
and minimum required samples sizes ``sample size``.

To install pypowerup, run this command in your terminal:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install pypowerup


To use the functions: 

.. code:: python

   from pypowerup import effect_size, power, sample_size
